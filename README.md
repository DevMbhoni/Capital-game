# Capital-game
The aim of the game is to get all the letters to be capitals. To change the letters in the grid, the user will select a letter (e.g., ‘p’ – case does not matter), then it and all adjacent letters in the same row or column (e.g., ‘l’, ‘o’, ‘p’) are toggled (uppercase to lowercase or lowercase to uppercase). This continues until the player succeeds or decides to quit. Each time the player plays a new game, randomly decide which letters will be uppercase or lowercase initially.

The selecting of a letter should trigger the letter itself and adjacent letters to toggle. Toggling values can trigger the calculation of whether the game has been won or not.
